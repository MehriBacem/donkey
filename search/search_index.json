The intention of the Donkey Store is to make it easier and less expensive to build the Donkey Car.  The Donkey Store is run by the original founders of donkey car and all profits are used to fund development of the donkey cars.  Also it is worth noting the design of the parts out of the Donkey store is slightly improved over the standard build as it uses better parts that are only available in large quantities or are harder to get.

See below (courtesy of Traxxas).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart Description\n\n\nLink\n\n\nApproximate Cost\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiPo Battery\n\n\nhobbyking.com/en_us/turnigy-1800mah-2s-20c-lipo-pack.html\n or \namazon.com/gp/product/B0072AERBE/\n\n\n$8.94 to $~17\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLipo Charger (takes 1hr to charge the above battery)\n\n\namazon.com/gp/product/B00XU4ZR06\n\n\n$13\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLipo Battery Case (to prevent damage if they explode)\n\n\namazon.com/gp/product/B00T01LLP8\n\n\n$8\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardware\n\n\nIf you purchased parts from the Donkey Car Store, skip to step 3.\n\n\nStep 1: Print Parts\n\n\nIf you do not have a 3D Printer, you can order parts from \nDonkey Store\n, \nShapeways\n or \n3dHubs\n.  I printed parts in black PLA, with 2mm layer height and no supports.  The top roll bar is designed to be printed upside down.   Remember that you need to print the adapters unless you have a \"Magnet\"\n\n\nI printed parts in black PLA, with .3mm layer height with a .5mm nozzle and no supports.  The top roll bar is designed to be printed upside down.  \n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Clean up parts\n\n\nAlmost all 3D Printed parts will need clean up.  Re-drill holes, and clean up excess plastic.\n\n\n\n\nIn particular, clean up the slots in the side of the roll bar, as shown in the picture below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Assemble Top plate and Roll Cage\n\n\nIf you have an Exceed Short Course Truck, Blaze or Desert Monster watch this \nvideo\n\n\nSlide the nut into the slot in the side of the roll cage.  This is not particularly easy.  You may need to clean out the hole again and use a small screwdriver to push the screw in such that it lines up with the hole in the bottom of the roll cage.\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have slid the nut in, you can attach the bottom plate.  Once again, this may be tricky.  I use the small screwdriver to push against the nut to keep it from spinning in the slot.  Good news: you should never have to do this again.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Connect Servo Shield to Raspberry Pi.\n\n\nYou could do this after attaching the Raspberry Pi to the bottom plate, I just think it is easier to see the parts when they are laying on the workbench.  Connect the parts as you see below:\n\n\n\n\nFor reference, below is the Raspberry Pi Pinout for reference.  You will notice we connect to 3.3v, the two I2C pins (SDA and SCL) and ground:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Attach Raspberry Pi to 3D Printed bottom plate.\n\n\nBefore you start, now is a good time to insert the already flashed SD card and bench test the electronics.  Once that is done, attaching the Raspberry Pi and Servo is as simple as running screws through the board into the screw bosses on the top plate.  The M2.5x12mm screws should be the perfect length to go through the board, the plastic and still have room for a washer.  The \u201ccap\u201d part of the screw should be facing up and the nut should be on the bottom of the top plate.  The ethernet and USB ports should face forward.  This is important as it gives you access to the SD card and makes the camera ribbon cable line up properly.\n\n\nAttach the USB battery to the underside of the printed bottom plate using cable ties or velcro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Attach Camera\n\n\nAttaching the camera is a little tricky, the M2 screws can be screwed into the plastic but it is a little hard.  I recommend drilling the holes out with a 1.5mm bit (1/16th bit in Imperial land) then pre threading them with the screws before putting the camera on. It is only necessary to put two screws in.\n\n\n\n\nSometimes using the two top screw holes can result in a short. Put screws in the bottom two holes.\n\n\n\n\nBefore using the car, remove the plastic film from the camera lens.\n\n\n\n\nIt is easy to put the camera cable in the wrong way so look at these photos and make sure the cable is put in properly.  There are loads of tutorials on youtube if you are not used to this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 7: Put it all together\n\n\n Note if you have a Desert Monster Chassis see 7B section below \n\nThe final steps are straightforward.  First attach the roll bar assembly to the car.  This is done using the same pins that came with the vehicle.  \n\n\n\n\nSecond run the servo cables up to the car.  The throttle cable runs to channel 0 on the servo controller and steering is channel 1.\n\n\n\n\nNow you are done with the hardware!!\n\n\nStep 7b: Attach Adapters (Desert Monster only)\n\n\nThe Desert monster does not have the same set up for holding the body on the car and needs two adapters mentioned above.  To attach the adapters you must first remove the existing adapter from the chassis and screw on the custom adapter with the same screws as is shown in this photo:\n\n\n\n\nOnce this is done, go back to step 7\n\n\n\n\nSoftware\n\n\nCongrats!

The \u201ccap\u201d part of the screw should be facing up and the nut should be on the bottom of the top plate.  The ethernet and USB ports should face forward.

The fastest way is to use the disk image created for donkey cars. \n\n\nThe method for using a disk image to create a bootable SD card varies between\noperating systems. These instructions are for Ubuntu but you can see more \ninstructions \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nDownload prebuilt \nzipped disk image\n (1.1GB). \n\n\nUnzip the disk image.\n\n\nPlug your SD card into your computer.\n\n\nOpen the \"Startup Disk Creator\" application.\n\n\nSelect your source disk image as the one you unzipped earlier.\n\n\nSelect your SD card as the disk to use. \n\n\nClick \"Make startup disk\".\n\n\n\n\nSetup the Pi's WiFi for first boot\n\n\nWe can create a special file which will be used to login to wifi on first boot. More reading \nhere\n, but we will walk you through it. \n\n\nOn Windows, with your memory card image burned and memory disc still inserted, you should see two drives, which are actually two partitions on the mem disc. One is labeled \nboot\n. On Mac and Linux, you should also have access to the \nboot\n partition of the mem disc. This is formated with the common FAT type and is where we will edit some files to help it find and log-on to your wifi on it's first boot.\n\n\n\n\nStart a text editor: \ngedit\n on Linux. Notepad on Windows. TextEdit on a Mac.\n\n\nPaste and edit this contents to match your wifi:\n\n\n\n\ncountry=US\nctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev\nupdate_config=1\n\nnetwork={\n    ssid=\nyour network name\n\n    psk=\nyour password\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nReplace \nyour network name\n with the ID of your network. Leave the quotes. I've seen problems when the network name contained an apostrophe, like \"Joe's iPhone\".\nReplace \nyour password\n with your password, leaving it surrounded by quotes. \nIf it bothers you to leave your password unencrypted, you may change the \ncontents later\n once you've gotten the pi to boot and log-in.\n\n\n\n\nSave this file to the root of \nboot\n partition with the filename \nwpa_supplicant.conf\n. On first boot, this file will be moved to \n/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf\n where it may be edited later.\n\n\n\n\nSetup Pi's Hostname\n\n\nWe can also setup the hostname so that your Pi easier to find once on the network. If yours is the only Pi on the network, then you can find it with \n\n\nping d2.local\n\n\n\n\nonce it's booted. If there are many other Pi's on the network, then this will have problems. If you are on a Linux machine, or are able to edit the UUID partition, then you can edit the \n/etc/hostname\n and \n/etc/hosts\n files now to make finding your pi on the network easier after boot. Edit those to replace \nraspberrypi\n with a name of your choosing. Use all lower case, no special characters, no hyphens, no underscores \n_\n. \n\n\nsudo vi /media/userID/UUID/etc/hostname\nsudo vi /media/userID/UUID/etc/hosts\n\n\n\n\nNow you're SD card is ready. Eject it from your computer, put it in the Pi \nand plug in the Pi.\n\n\nConnecting to the Pi\n\n\nIf you followed the above instructions to add wifi access you're Pi should\nnow be connected to your wifi network. Now you need to find it's IP address\nso you can connect to it via SSH. \n\n\nThe easiest way (on Ubuntu) is to use the \nfindcar\n donkey command. You can try \nping raspberrypi.local\n. If you've modified the hostname, then you should try: \nping \nyour hostname\n.local\n. This will fail on a windows machine. Windows users will need the full IP address (unless using cygwin). \n\n\nIf you are having troubles locating your Pi on the network, you will want to plug in an HDMI monitor and USB keyboard into the Pi. Boot it. Login with:\n\n\n\n\nUsername: \npi\n\n\nPassword: \nasdfasdf\n\n\nThe older disk images use the password \nraspberry\n\n\n\n\nThen try the command:\n\n\nifconfig wlan0\n\n\n\n\nIf this has a valid IPv4 address, 4 groups of numbers separated by dots, then you can try that with your SSH command. If you don't see anything like that, then your wifi config might have a mistake. You can try to fix with\n\n\nsudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't have a HDMI monitor and keyboard, you can plug-in the Pi with a CAT5 cable to a router with DHCP. If that router is on the same network as your PC, you can try:\n\n\nping d2.local\n\n\n\n\nHopefully, one of those methods worked and you are now ready to SSH into your Pi. On Mac and Linux, you can open Terminal. On Windows you can install \nPutty\n or \none of the alternatives\n.\n\n\nIf you have a command prompt, you can try:\n\n\nssh pi@d2.local\n\n\n\n\nor\n\n\nssh pi@\nyour pi ip address\n\n\n\n\n\nor via Putty:\n\n Username: \npi\n\n\n Password: \nasdfasdf\n\n  * \nasdfasdf\n on the current v22 prebuilt image linked above.\n  * \nraspberry\n on older images/manual installs\n* Hostname:\nyour pi IP address\n\n\nIf you are using the prebuilt image specified above, then your Pi is ready to go. You should see a d2 and donkey directory. \n\n\n\n\nNote: Check config.py to make sure it uses the correct settings for the PWM channel for steering and throttle. Open config.py \nnano ~/d2/config.py\n and make sure that you see the lines:\n\n\n\n\nSTEERING_CHANNEL = 1\n\n\nTHROTTLE_CHANNEL = 0\n\n\n\n\nThe 1 and 0 for the parts arguments should match whichever channel you used to plug your servo/ESC leads in to your 9685 board. Usually this ranges from 0-15 and it numbered on the board.\n\n\nNote: If you are using the prebuilt image specified above, your Pi is not using the full capacity of the SD card. To make the full capacity accessible, SSH into the Pi and run \nsudo raspi-config\n to go into the configuration tool. Select \n7 Advanced Options\n and \nA1 Expand Filesystem\n. And then select \nFinish\n to exit the configuration tool and reboot. The Pi can access the full capacity of the SD card now.\n\n\n\n\nUpdate Donkeycar Python code and install\n\n\nThe donkeycar Python code on the memory card image is likely older than the that on the Github repo, so update things once you have the Pi running.\n\n\ncd ~/donkeycar\ngit pull\npip install -e .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow let's setup the same donkey library on your laptop or server so you can test and train autopilots. Install varies \ndepending on platform.\n\n\nInstall donkeycar on Linux\n\n\nInstall dependencies, setup virtualenv\n\n\nsudo apt-get install virtualenv build-essential python3-dev gfortran libhdf5-dev\nvirtualenv env -p python3\nsource env/bin/activate\npip install keras==2.0.6\npip install tensorflow==1.3.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall donkey source and create your local working dir:\n\n\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/wroscoe/donkey donkeycar\npip install -e donkeycar\n\n\n\n\nNext: Calibrate your car.\n\n\n\n\nInstall donkeycar on Windows\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstall \nminiconda Python 3.6 64 bit\n.

The first thing to note after running the command above, is to look at the options in the Mode \n Pilot menu. It can be pretty confusing. So here's what the different options mean:\n\n\na. \nUser\n : As you guessed, this is where you are in control of both the steering and throttle control.\n\n\nb. \nLocal Angle\n : Not too obvious, but this is where the trained model (mypilot from above) controls the steering. The \nLocal\n refers to the trained model which is locally hosted on the raspberry-pi.\n\n\nc. \nLocal Pilot\n : This is where the trained model (mypilot) assumes control of both the steering and the throttle. As of now, it's purportedly not very reliable.\n\n\nBe sure to also check out the \nMax Throttle\n and \nThrottle Mode\n options, and play around with a few settings. Can help with training quite a lot. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuild a Simple Track\n : This isn't very well-documented, but the car should (theoretically) be able to train against any kind of track. To start off with, it might not be necessary to build a two-lane track with a striped center-lane. Try with a single lane with no center-line, or just a single strip that makes a circuit! At the least, you'll be able to do an end-to-end testing and verify that the software pipeline is all properly functional. Of course, as the next-step, you'll want to create a more standard track, and compete at a \nmeetup\n nearest to you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet help\n : Try to get some helping hands from a friend or two. Again, this helps immensely with building the track, because it is harder than it looks to build a two-line track on your own! Also, you can save on resources (and tapes) by using a \nribbon\n instead of tapes. They'll still need a bit of tapes to hold them, but you can reuse them and they can be laid down with a lot less effort (Although the wind, if you're working outside, might make it difficult to lay them down initially).",

It can be pretty confusing. So here's what the different options mean:  a.  User  : As you guessed, this is where you are in control of both the steering and throttle control.  b.  Local Angle  : Not too obvious, but this is where the trained model (mypilot from above) controls the steering. The  Local  refers to the trained model which is locally hosted on the raspberry-pi.  c.  Local Pilot  : This is where the trained model (mypilot) assumes control of both the steering and the throttle. As of now, it's purportedly not very reliable.  Be sure to also check out the  Max Throttle  and  Throttle Mode  options, and play around with a few settings. Can help with training quite a lot.     Build a Simple Track  : This isn't very well-documented, but the car should (theoretically) be able to train against any kind of track. To start off with, it might not be necessary to build a two-lane track with a striped center-lane. Try with a single lane with no center-line, or just a single strip that makes a circuit! At the least, you'll be able to do an end-to-end testing and verify that the software pipeline is all properly functional. Of course, as the next-step, you'll want to create a more standard track, and compete at a  meetup  nearest to you!    Get help  : Try to get some helping hands from a friend or two. Again, this helps immensely with building the track, because it is harder than it looks to build a two-line track on your own! Also, you can save on resources (and tapes) by using a  ribbon  instead of tapes. They'll still need a bit of tapes to hold them, but you can reuse them and they can be laid down with a lot less effort (Although the wind, if you're working outside, might make it difficult to lay them down initially).",

This simulator is built on the the Unity game platform, uses their internal physics and graphics, and connects to a donkey Python process to use our trained model to control the simulated Donkey.\n\n\nDownload the Simulator\n\n\nYou will need a specific build per platform:\n\n\n\n\nUbuntu 16.04 \ndownload\n\n\nMac 10.10.5+ \ndownload\n\n\nWindows 7+ \ndownload\n\n\n\n\nExtract this compressed file. It will create a folder containing an executable. Double click that executable to launch the simulator.\n\n\nExtra Mac Steps\n\n\nIf logs are not being generated you are probably running a version of OS X that sandboxes untrusted applications. This prevents the simulator writing to disk. To resolve this, move the executable within the Applications folder.\n\n\nRecorded Data\n\n\nThis simulator can create log data in the donkey tub format. This is stored in the \nlog\n dir at the root of the folder next to the executable. On the mac you will need to browse the package contents to see this folder. If this folder is missing, no data will be recorded.\n\n\nYou can choose two different scenes.\n\n\nGenerated Road Scene\n\n\nThe purpose of this is to create a randomly generated road so that you can have miles of curves on different road surfaces. You can train on one road and test on something similar, or a totally different surface.\n\n\nWarehouse Scene\n\n\nThe purpose of this is to create a specific track that is somewhat similar to an actual course in use as the primary track for the Oakland DIYRobocars Meetup.\n\n\n\n\nMenu Options:\n\n\nJoystick/Keyboard No Rec\n\n\nDrive the donkey with a joystick or keyboard. I used a PS2 Joystick and a PS3 Joystick. Keyboard controls use arrow keys to steer. In this mode, no data is recorded.\n\n\n\n\nNote: Keyboard data produces steering information that is stepped (ie. -1, 0, +1) and may be difficult to train with. See below for joystick setup.\n\n\n\n\nJoystick/Keyboard w Rec\n\n\nDrive the donkey with a joystick or keyboard. In this mode, data is stored in the tub donkey format.\n\n\nAuto Drive No Rec\n\n\nThis uses path information to guide the donkey down the track. It uses a PID controller to steer, so there is some oscillation. In this mode, no data is stored.\n\n\nAuto Drive w Rec\n\n\nThis uses path information to guide the donkey down the track. It uses a PID controller to steer, so there is some oscillation. In this mode, data is stored in the tub donkey format.\n\n\nNext Track\n\n\nIn the generated road scene, this will switch out the road surface and track width.\n\n\nRegen Track\n\n\nUse the current surface type, but generate a new random path and road.\n\n\n\n\nPID Controls\n\n\nMax Speed\n\n\nThis setting determines the target speed during the PID auto drive. It will also affect the speed when driving by keyboard controls (not recommended).\n\n\nProp\n\n\nThis is short for proportional. This is the P part of PID that attempts to adjust steering back to the path in proportion to the deviation.\n\n\nDiff\n\n\nThis is the D part of PID that attempts to limit steering back to the path as derivative to the trend of deviation, designed to limit overshoot.\n\n\nMax Steering\n\n\n\n\nNote - Max Steering is an important adjustment. This affects categorical training quite strongly. As the steering data is normalized when written, and multiplies after coming from Python, this angle should remain constant over training and simulation. Take care when changing this value. And separate data and models by max steering setting.\n\n\n\n\nMax steering can only be adjusted when using \nAuto Drive No Rec\n. It will also affect joystick and keyboard steering range, and should be saved and reloaded for you.\n\n\nThe default categorical model has 16 bins, or classes. And so, with a max steering of +-16, each bin will represent 2 degrees. It is helpful to graph the model training vs the example data to get and intuition about how it fits the data.\n\n\n\n\nTypical Use\n\n\n\n\nStart simulator\n\n\nDouble check that \nlog\n dir exists and is empty\n\n\nStart scene of your choice\n\n\nHit \nAuto Drive w Rec\n button\n\n\nVary the Max Speed, Prop, and Diff sliders to obtain a variety of driving styles\n\n\nWait 10-15 minutes until you have recorded 10K+ frames of data.\n\n\nHit the \nStop\n button\n\n\nHit the \nExit\n button\n\n\nMove the \nlog\n dir to the \n~/d2/data/\n dir where you normally put tub data. This will create a \n~/d2/data/log\n path.\n\n\nTrain as usual. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: I had problems w default categorical model. Linear model worked better for me.\n\n\n\n\npython manage.py train --tub=data/log --model=models/mypilot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart the simulator server. \n\n\n\n\ndonkey sim --model=models/mypilot\n\n\n\n\nWait to see \nwsgi starting up on http://0.0.0.0:9090\n\n\n\n\nEnter the scene of your choice in the simulator\n\n\nHit the button \nNN Steering w Websockets\n\n\nYour donkey should begin to move. You should see in the upper left two values for incoming steering and throttle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoystick Setup\n\n\nKeyboard input provides a poor learning signal. I recommend using the joystick to provide manual driving data. \n\n\nLinux Joystick Setup\n\n\nUnity on Linux uses the SDL library to see your joystick. And in particular the GamePad API. This is not setup by default. I needed to do these steps:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/Grumbel/sdl-jstest\n\nsudo apt-get install cmake\nsudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev\nsudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev\nsudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev\ncd sdl-jstest\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\nmake install\n\n\n./sdl2-jstest -l\n\n\n\n\nLook for:\nJoystick GUID: 030000004f04000008b1000000010000\n\n\nThe GUID will be different depending on your device.\n\n\nThen open:\nhttps://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB/blob/master/gamecontrollerdb.txt\n\n\nand look for your GUID in Linux section. One line is for one device type. Now modify your environment to specify information for your device:\n\n\nsudo -H gedit /etc/environment\n\n\n\n\nadd the line SDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG=, make sure to add the quotes at begin and end. ie.\n\n\nSDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG=\"030000004f04000008b1000000010000, ... and the rest of the long line copied from gamecontrollerdb\"\n\n\n\n\nreboot\n\n\nstart sim\n\n\nchoose drive w joystick\n\n\nmove sticks\n\n\ndo happy dance",
